## Feature Selection for Mixed Models
*Under the guidance of Dr. Aleksander Aravkin.*

My current primary research interest, a.k.a. my attempt to earn a Ph.D. in applied math, can be broadly described as "Feature Selection and Uncertainty Quantification for Mixed Models in Population Health''. It is mostly centered around my work as a graduate research student at IHME. Here mixed models are used in many projects, and I am working on improving the stability and validity of these statistical models, mainly through efficient algorithms for feature selection and quantification of uncertainty. An $\alpha$-implementation of my ideas can be found [here](https://github.com/aksholokhov/skmixed).

## COVID-Project
As a part of my work in [IHME Math Sciences Team](https://github.com/ihmeuw-msca), I was involved into the creation and implementation of [IHME SEIIR COVID Model](http://www.healthdata.org/sites/default/files/files/Projects/COVID/Estimation_update_050420.pdf), which has been [in use](https://covid19.healthdata.org/projections) staring May, 5th, 2020.

## MEMOIR
*Jointly with Maximov Yury, Massih-Resa Amini, and Belyy Anton.*

This ongoing work aims to enable the use of Kernel SVMs for extreme multiclass classification problems via novel similarity search techniques. One intermediate result we got was the integration of approximate maximal inner product search techniques into the Pegasos algorithm, which gave us a boost in convergence speed as well as a flexible memory-precision trade-off mechanism. See the [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.09863) for more details.

## RySearch
*Jointly with Belyy Anton, Mariia Selezniova, and Konstantin Vorontsov.*

The project was aimed to utilize hierarchical topic modeling techniques to create an exploratory search engine for large heterogeneous text corpora. This work resulted in a [prototype](https://github.com/AVBelyy/Rysearch/graphs/contributors) of such an engine, as well as in [several new approaches](http://www.dialog-21.ru/media/4562/belyyavplusetal.pdf) to automatic quality measuring for hierarchical topic models.
