I am currently a Ph.D. student in the Department of Applied Mathematics of the University of Washington. I work under the guidance of Dr. Aleksander Aravkin. I am also a graduate research student in the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluations at UW. My current research interest is centered around feature selection and uncertainty quantification for statistical models, in particular for mixed models, with application to population health problems. Here is my [CV]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link /assets/docs/cv_academics.pdf %}).
