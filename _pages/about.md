I am a PhD Student in Applied Mathematics at the [University of Washington](https://amath.washington.edu). I work on Machine Learning applications to scientific problems as a Research Assistant at [DynamicsAI](https://dynamicsai.org).

Over the last few years I had three internships:

 - At [Stripe](https://stripe.com), I was a Machine Learning Engineer tasked to build model calibration pipelines for fraud detection models. [[blogpost]]().

 - At [Mitsubishi Electric Research Labs (MERL)](https://merl.com), as a Machine Learning Researcher, I built deep learning models that predict evolution of complex physical processes. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09419), [[blogpost]]()

- At [Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME)](http://healthdata.org) I built an open-source tool for feature selection in mixed-effect models [pysr3](https://github.com/aksholokhov/pysr3). [papers: [1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.06925.pdf),[2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10575)], [[blogpost]](http://localhost:4000/projects/#feature-selection-for-mixed-models)

<!-- 
I am currently a Ph.D. student in the Department of Applied Mathematics of the University of Washington. I work under the guidance of Dr. Aleksander Aravkin. I am also a graduate research student in the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluations at UW. My current research interest is centered around feature selection and uncertainty quantification for statistical models, in particular for mixed models, with application to population health problems. Here is my [CV]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link /assets/docs/cv_academics.pdf %}). -->
